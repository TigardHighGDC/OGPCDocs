# Gameplay Ideas for OGPC 2022 - 2023

Theme for this year is **Breaking Conventions**.

## General Notes

- Best to start with only one core mechanic.
  - Add lots of polish to a basic mechanic.
  - Other things can be added later if we need more substance.

## General Game Ideas

1. Game Reversed
    - Each core gameplay mechanic is reversed. (ex. you want to land in the spikes not the flag).
2. Abilities Dangerous
    - Each time you die or succeed, you lose an ability.
    - The game makes itself harder as you lose abilities as you win.
    - Randomize the abilities you lose (adds replayability).
3. Move the level
    - Instead of moving the player move the level.
    - You control the level not the player.
4. 2nd Person
    - You see yourself from an outside camera.
    - Shown in the video we watched as a group.
    - Hard concept to do well.
    - Backseat gaming (watching a streamer play a game; you get to tell them what to do).
5. Intentional Bugs
    - Bugs are a part of the core game play. (Any real bugs becomes features).
    - As you use more and more bugs the game becomes more and more corrupted.
    - The goal of the game would be to corrupt everything as much as possible.
    - Possible puzzle game.
6. You die you win
    - Constantly being healed, try to die as fast as possible.
    - Good story opportunities.
7. Game similar to Plagued Inc
    - Rouge like game where you infect your enemies, perhaps giving them abilities.
    - Make them want to spread the plague.
    - Start them with risky behaviors and as it goes on people get smarter.
    - Starts with everything overpowered and as it goes on it gets weaker.
8. Two player co-op game
    - Similar to Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.
9. Quest Giving
    - You give the "player" a quest to complete.
10. Water a tree
    - Prob falls under the "Game Reversed" category. (ty Mr. Woodward).

## Big Ideas

1. Virus
    - All game ideas from above are included where the core idea is that everything is being corrupted.
    - Each section is its own mechanic where at the end it gets more and more broken.
    - Gives a chance for every idea to shine and provides lots of unique opportunities for gameplay.
    - Cool ideas for lore and story.
      - Sentient computer virus is slowly taking over the game.
      - Game within a game.
      - Lore similar to Superhot.
      - Player gets more and more confused as time goes on, just trying to escape the game.
      - Computer starts corrupted and player is trying to un-corrupt each time gaining new abilities, roguelike
      - Connected with game is brocken
    - Similar to Evoland and Evoland 2.
    - As time goes on the game gets intentionally less and less finished and more and more janky.
      - Will save us some time and add depth to the game.
    - Abilities have a certain number of uses before they break.
      - You need to use an ability to get another one but you need to be careful as the more uses of an ability will cause the game to break more and more.
2. Corrupt abilities
    - Combine the corruption idea with the idea of abilities being dangerous.
        - Explosives, heavy speed
        - Abilities has bad side effects
        - Abilities hard to control
3. Game is buggy
    - Game breaking abilities
    - Unfinished
        - Terrible sound effects
        - Unfinished art
    - Unbalanced world
        - Enemies op or weak
        - Using glitches to defeat op enemies  
        - Certain attacks doesn't effect the bosses
    - Using glitches to complete puzzles
4. Horror but bad
    - Obvious jump scares
    - Player is the one trying to scare people
